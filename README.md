# Machine Learning Summer Course - National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA)

This repository contains solutions to the exercise lists from the Machine Learning Summer Course offered by IMPA. Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise list and includes:

- The original exercise list as a PDF (with Content in the filename).
- My proposed solutions as a PDF (with Solutions in the filename).
- Jupyter notebooks used to solve coding-related questions.

The solutions are written in Brazilian Portuguese, but I have translated some comments in the code for better understanding.
